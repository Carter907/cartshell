# Cartshell - A C Shell

Right now this project's code is very generic (as in not focused or opinionated). I want to keep it general enough so I when I'm focused I can take this project up into a full-fledged shell with all the cool features of one like Bash. I know that's a big project but I want to learn about shells at a fundamental level and this is the perfect project. I may change my mind in the future and specialize this shell in some way but those thoughts are for another day. Right now, this project is perfect for forking and it's going to be that way for a little bit.
